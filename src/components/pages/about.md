# About

Hi there, I'm Tetrabyte also known as Dustin Rouillard. I'm a back-end developer who specializes in node.js and who is familer with front-end work, I'm currently learning Go, and Elixir to advance my skill set.

I'm not very good at frontend work, but I'm learning more about Vue everyday, this site was actually created using Vue from the knowledge I gained while working on Notify.me
